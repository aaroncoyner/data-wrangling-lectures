# data-wrangling-lectures

Lecture materials for HIP 523: Data Science for Clinical & Translational Research. Includes lecture slides and an interactive introduction to clinical data wrangling and model building.

These are simply adaptations from [Ted Laderas's](https://github.com/laderast) introductory course to [clinical data wrangling](https://github.com/laderast/clinical_data_wrangling).
