from Will to everyone:
Mine says, 'no projects'

523*
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
No worries. Thanks!
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
yes, the book has something silimar to word interface
from Shane Griffin to everyone:
I am having a lot of trouble understanding you, perhaps this is just me...
from Will to everyone:
Audio was skipping for me too
from Will to everyone:
sounds better now
from Will to everyone:
got it
from Luong Doan to everyone:
working for me
from Savannah Mcnichol (privately):
Hi, I think we lost your audio for a bit but it's back now
from Shane Griffin to everyone:
got it
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
got it
from Taylor Vega to everyone:
i see the predictive modeling project
from Bethany Samuelson Bannow to everyone:
i see it too
from Juan Piantino to everyone:
got it!
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
i dont have it
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
no project
from Juan Piantino to everyone:
got it
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
i do not have it
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
:-(
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
seems liek I am the only one without access
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
I do not have it
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
does everybody else have it?
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
Try logging out and coming back in
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
tried that as well
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
no luck
from Brian Chan to everyone:
i had to log out, then log back in
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
I had better luck in chrome
from Brian Chan to everyone:
and yes, chrome better luck
from Juan Piantino to everyone:
yeah  I'm using Chrome as well
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
Can you show how to get to the current window?
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
thanks
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
got it
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Where is the datafile saved? Is it on Sakai? 
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Okay I couldn't get the cloud to work, I'll keep trying. I thought I could download the datafile to regular R studio (non cloud version). I'll keep trying!
from Allison Allen to everyone:
I am having trouble finding how to get to this window
from Allison Allen to everyone:
All i have in the files tab is the data file
from Brian Chan to everyone:
i don't see the 'play' button
from Brian Chan to everyone:
89
from Brian Chan to everyone:
oh i see it- thanks!
from Savannah Mcnichol (privately):
Hi Ted, Allison said she "does not have any of the boxes under the 'files' tab" so she cannot do any of the coding he is talking about. "All I have is the 'dataset.rd'"
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Can someone type in the chatbox the code to get the data in  global environment? 
from Will to everyone:
Some lines are factors other are numeric
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Thank you! 
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
There are quite a few missing variables
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
oops values, thanks
from Luong Doan to everyone:
the play button is not showing up and I'm not getting gray lines. Am i missing something?
from Luong Doan to everyone:
104 to 106
from Luong Doan to everyone:
still not
from Luong Doan to everyone:
no
from Luong Doan to everyone:
it is, but i'll just follow along on the screen
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Okay backing up, how do I get the initial markdown file to load the data in the global environment? Is that somewhere in the workspace? 
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
scroll up and read from the top
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Session2.predictive_model.rmd? is the markdownfile on Sakai? 
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Is that in sakai? 
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
No, it's in R studio cloud
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
where? 
from Luong Doan to everyone:
https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/67684/join?access_code=wO4%2FjJkfsWHeqbEzde%2BwBZcacVk1U6%2FdfpqNgn1%2F
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
YEs I'm in that but I don't see how to get the markdown file! 
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
I'll check in at the break! 
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
I see a slightly different variation than what your screen is showing. 
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
IT just opens to a blank r console. 
from Elizabeth Berry (privately):
You have the patience of a saint. Thank so much for taking us through this step by step!
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Weirdly I don't have any files like that
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
But I'm in the HIP_523 projects, and I see the predictive modeling
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Yes. 
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
dataset.rds
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
K now I see the markdown! 
from Will to everyone:
3500
from Juan Piantino to everyone:
yup
from Shane Griffin to everyone:
Will each of us have identical data in each partitioned group?
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
Ted, how do I initiate a project and share it? Can you show that?
from Shane Griffin to everyone:
thank you, that makes sense
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
can R  be used for meta analysis?
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
I'm now getting an error when I run the codes that says "Error in eval...: object 'hosp_readmit_data_model' not found
from Kamalika Roy (privately):
thanks
from Luong Doan to everyone:
I stopped seeing the play button part way through.  Not sure if i misclicked
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
Hmm-- I had to use my laptop so I'm using a separate computer
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
Super. Thanks!
from Shaalini Ramanadhan (privately):
How do you decide what % should be test vs train data?
from Luong Doan to everyone:
thanks
from Will to everyone:
yes
from Juan Piantino to everyone:
yes
from Shane Griffin to everyone:
yes
from drhad to everyone:

from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
not close to 1
from Juan Piantino to everyone:
no
from Bethany Samuelson Bannow to everyone:

from Shane Griffin to everyone:
not significant
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
yes
from Elizabeth Berry to everyone:
yes
from drhad to everyone:
what is <dbi>?
from Will to everyone:
<dbl> means "double" it's a type of numerical data
from drhad to everyone:
ok
from Shane Griffin to everyone:
false positive/negative
from Emily Quinn to everyone:
Do you want our models to include multiple covariates?
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
can you explain how to pursue the train_data2 <- hosp_readmit_data_filtered2[train_index,]
test_data2 <- hosp_readmit_data_filtered2[-train_index,]?
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
thanks
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
thank you
from Will to everyone:
done
from Will (privately):
yes
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
showed error
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
:-)
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
i did something wrong
from Luong Doan to everyone:
why does it finish with a , instead of { like the input model example?
from Luong Doan to everyone:
thank you
from Shane Griffin to everyone:
done
from Elizabeth Berry (privately):
I can't get beyond the first variable entry. I'm super embarrassed! I can't share my screen because I'm using a separate laptop
from Ted Laderas to everyone:
formula = readmit30 ~ diabetes_complications + admit_source
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
I am feeling like trying to learn Russian or German
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
so yes, it is anxiety provoking
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
i really need to learn it thouggh
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
is there any other calss you do about this
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
i am graduating, even this class is extra for me, but I need to learn this. So its called Ready for R
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
ok, I will ask Savannah to help finding that class
from Ted Laderas to everyone:

from Juan Piantino to everyone:
Done. My model has a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 0% :)
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
:-)
from Juan Piantino to everyone:
hahaha
from Juan Piantino to everyone:
sure
from Will to everyone:
I bet your model predicts no readmits
from Will to everyone:
oops, I had it backwards. Your model predicts all readmits
from Kamalika Roy to everyone:
Juan can to scroll up the the beginning of your model?
from Bethany Samuelson Bannow to everyone:
I keep getting this message:  Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'readmit30' not found
from Bethany Samuelson Bannow to everyone:
i will try i have two screens
from Brian Chan to everyone:
i did: basic_model2 <- glm(readmit30 ~ diabetes_complications + myocardial_complications
            + length_of_stay + admit_source,
from Brian Chan to everyone:
Sn 0.18, Sp .95
from Will to everyone:
needs a comma
from Brian Chan to everyone:
needs , 
from Bethany Samuelson Bannow to everyone:
thanks!
